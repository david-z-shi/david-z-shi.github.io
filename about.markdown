I am a current research technician at [Sharma Lab](https://www.nsharmalab.com) at Columbia University.

I graduated from the Johns Hopkins University with a bachelor's in Biomedical Engineering.
My research interests are in neurobiology, neural circuits and understanding how various
celltypes contribute to the propagation of signals and overall function.
